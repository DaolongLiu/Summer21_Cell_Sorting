# Summer21_Cell_Sorting
Summer project for multiplex cell sorting

## Tools:
- MATLAB image toolbox
- Computation and data: numpy, pandas
- Machine learning: scikit-learn, pytorch (or tf/keras if you prefer)

## Project statement:
Create a systematic pipeline for multiplex cell sorting including:
  - image preprocessing
  - integrating physical information w/ cell images
  - return decision signal
  - good documentation

## ML/DL model
- Establish DL model for cell classification / detection
  - single cell classification via Deep CNN (ResNet/VGG)
  - detection model (YOLO)
- Multiplex condition for the same job including:
  - deformation
  - cell velocity
- Dynamic cell images as the input

## TO DO LIST
- [ ] polishing the image toolbox
- [ ] building up simple classification model
- [ ] building up RNN-encoder model
- [ ] building up multi-input architecture
